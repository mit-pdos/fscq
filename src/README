To build fscq, use a version of Coq v8.5; for now, this seems to mean
building Coq from source:

  git clone -b v8.5 https://github.com/coq/coq.git

As one reference point, commit eaa3f971 seems to produce a working
version of Coq that builds fscq.

To develop Coq code using CoqIDE, check out coqide.sh, which invokes
coqide with the appropriate arguments for spawning many parallel coqtop
processes and setting the right logical-to-physical path mappings.

Use GHC 8.0.1 to build the Haskell-extracted code.  On Ubuntu 17.04,
the stock version of GHC is sufficiently recent, so just run:

  echo 'library-profiling: True' >> ~/.cabal/config
  cabal user-config update
  cabal update
  cabal install cryptohash rdtsc digest

You also need to install headers for FUSE:

  apt-get install libfuse-dev

To build the Ocaml extracted code, install the following Ocaml libraries:

  apt-get install libextunix-ocaml-dev libzarith-ocaml-dev

To run the fuse fscq:

  mkdir /tmp/fscq
  ./mkfs disk.img
  ./fscq disk.img -f -o big_writes,atomic_o_trunc /tmp/fscq &

To use fscq:

  echo hello > /tmp/fscq/h.txt
  cat h.txt
  ls /tmp/fscq/
  etc.

To see stats:

  cat /tmp/fscq/stats

To unmount:

  fusermount -u /tmp/fscq

To run benchmarks, see bench/

To produce Go code, use Go 1.4+ (it's faster and has a better GC).
